    # cc_internal_api is the URL used by Eirini to call the Cloud Controller.

    # cc_tls_disabled specifies wether Eirini should communicate to the Cloud
    # Controller via HTTPS or not. This should be set to false if TLS is
    # handled transparently, e.g. by a service mesh.
    #
    # When cc_tls_disabled is false, which is the default, a secret must be
    # provided for the cc-certs volume in core/api-deployment.yml. This must
    # have entries tls.ca, tls.crt and tls.key, for the TLS certificate
    # authority, client certificate and key respectively, used for mTLS with
    # the Cloud Controller.
