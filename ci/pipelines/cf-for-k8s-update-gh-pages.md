# cf-for-k8s-update-gh-pages

## Purpose
Updates the [cf-for-k8s docs site](https://cf-for-k8s.io/). Uses [hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) to generate
docs pages from the [cloudfoundry/cf-for-k8s-docs](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-for-k8s-docs) repo and push them
to the `gh-pages` branch, which is configured on GitHub to automatically update the docs site.
